## Personal Site (UNDER CONSTRUCTION) ##

This repo is for my personal site/portfolio

It was built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and React.js

To get the dang thing going, you'll need to get node.js and webpack-dev-server.

## Node ##

[node.js download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## webpack-dev-server ##

	npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev

Once this is done all you'll need to do is run the dang thing!

	npm run dev

Lemme know what ya'll think :)

Plz critique me, but be nice
